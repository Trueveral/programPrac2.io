                        <h1 style="color: #f2f5f8;font-weight: bold;">Introduction</h1>
                        <p style="color: #bcbcbc;font-family: Bitter, serif;">The attention to machine learning (defined as the automatic improvements of computer algorithms based on experience (IEEE)) and pattern recognition (defined as the automation of recognising patterns and norms of data (Bishop, 2006))
                            has rocketed in recent years. As news-reports on these topics surge, and technology companies, smartphones producers, in particular, are implementing security authentications based on machine learning and pattern recognition
                            gradually, these pioneering technologies are becoming commonplace. Meanwhile, the education systems might have been aware of such a tendency: As Ofsted, the Office for Standards in Education operated by the government of UK
                            were showing inclinations to deploy machine learning in its school- rating system (BBC, 2017). In the meantime, the widely reported intelligent classroom behaviour management system in China which analyses students’ expressions
                            and attitudes by scanning the whole classroom every 30 seconds, forming statistics, conclusions and suggestions in real time (Haridy, 2018), is taking full advantage of the powerful machine learning and pattern recognition
                            tools. Written in this essay is a discussion on the possible ways of deploying machine learning and pattern recognition to educational business, a peek of the resistance faced by these two technologies in educational sectors.
                            Additionally, demonstrating that providing that the schools persist with being prudential and cautious, machine learning and pattern recognition could be delightfully adopted in educational establishments.&nbsp;</p>
                        <h1 style="color: #f8f8f8;font-weight: bold;">Student's Performance</h1>
                        <p style="color: #bcbcbc;font-family: Bitter, serif;">Grade prediction based on machine learning was proven to be promising. In a Cornell University research including 1000 students’ data in 2006 from India’s Chief Education Office, the machine learning assisted chi-squared automatic
                            interaction detector(CHAID) model, has successfully predicted students’ grades and clarified several vital elements (way of teaching, junior school marks, area of the school and class, home location) influencing the performance
                            of a student. (Ramaswami, Bhaskaran, 2010) While other researchers have also revealed the accuracy of such an algorithm in anticipating the grades. As Kaur, Singh, Josan(2015) from Punjab Technical University stated, among
                            all the methods experimented by the researchers to predict slow learners based on a variety of data, the MLP (Multi-Layer Perception), a technic based on machine learning, performed the best. Another method, EDM (Education
                            Data Mining), also a part of<br>machine learning, has shown excellent capability in predicting students’ performances and has been expected to be widely applied in the prediction of stocks, medical care, and sports.<br></p>
                        <p
                            style="color: #bcbcbc;font-family: Bitter, serif;">Moreover, for customising students’ learning experiences, Hsu(2006) also proposed a data-mining based, automatic recommendation system for English-as-a-Second- Language (ESL) students, which, by showing the recommended index, gave
                            advice on subjects choices for students based on their previous readings. During the one-year period, it has been investigated that students’ confidence or agreement with this system has increased by 20.79%, showing the accuracy
                            of such a system.<br></p>
                            <p style="color: #bcbcbc;font-family: Bitter, serif;">In addition to these, the technologies could be used in correcting students’ papers in assistance of teachers. In a research carried out by scientists from The Chinese Academy of Sciences and Montreal University recently, comparing
                                the speed of recognising handwritten Chinese characters by separately machine learning and manual recognition, tools powered by the former, known as ConvNet and deep learning, was proven to recognise the characters more
                                accurately, and has overtaken the human performances. (96.95%, 97.37% versus 96.13% of accuracy) (Zhang, Bengio, Liu, 2016) Based on this feature of machine learning and pattern recognition, it seems possible that the handwritten
                                characters could be analysed by computers and compared with the answers stored in the system.</p>
                            <p style="color: #bcbcbc;font-family: Bitter, serif;">Overall, complex educational data could be analysed by machine learning, which is crucial for further predictions and the evolution of the technology itself. Along with pattern recognition, the technologies are promising to
                                improve the students’ academic performance and the efficiency of giving feedbacks, by predicting the grades, customising students’ learning experience, and identifying handwriting. In other aspects, apart from grades and
                                schoolwork, the operation of the campus may also benefit from the trend.</p>
                            <h1 style="color: #f8f8f8;font-weight: bold;">School Management</h1>
                            <p style="color: #bcbcbc;font-family: Bitter, serif;">Firstly, Students’ well-being was considered to be possibly enhanced by these methods. According to a bunch of medics from Guangzhou Medical University, Pan, Liu, Lin, Zhong, Xia, Sun and Liang(2017), in a research aimed at
                                the predictive diagnosis of relapsing childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), machine learning systems trained by the characters of 336 samples of ill children, has successfully predicted 82.9% of the newly introduced
                                cases. Which revealed the accuracy and the promising future of applying machine learning to medical diagnoses. Other researches agreed with such conduction. Shen, Zhang, Yan, Zhou(2018) suggested that the diagnosis of facial
                                acne vulgaris could be<br>obliged with a machine learning solution, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which was proven to be an adequate substitute for manual classification and was reported to possess the ability of
                                adjustment depending on the workload. Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Patil and Raj(2018) issued the possible mode of fast diagnosis: Facial recognition. It has been stated by the researchers
                                that the expression of face colour, the shape of the face, smile lines, and melanocytes may imply health conditions. In further researches, they proposed a model based on machine learning and pattern recognition to predict
                                diseases by analysing the facial characters on real samples. Although the model may remain unpractical, suggestions were made that such method to be experimented with and adopted by schools if possible. It has been assumed
                                that if schools were to introduce trained machine learning and pattern recognition systems to medical care, the efficiency and accuracy of the in-school clinics should develop to some extent.</p>
                            <p style="color: #bcbcbc;font-family: Bitter, serif;">Teachers in classes may also appreciate these technologies. Haridy(2018) reported that pattern recognition could be utilised in extracting and recognising students’ expressions and give essential feedbacks to the teacher, including
                                the students’ mood, attention, and spirit in the class. Such technology was said to be widely used in roughly 60,000 schools in China, known as the Intelligent Classroom Behaviour Management System (mentioned in the head
                                of the essay), to formulate reports on students’ attitudes and performances in class. A student who was previously negative in classes commented that “I do not dare be distracted since the cameras were installed in the
                                classrooms,” regardless of the slight nervousness that the system created. There are possibilities that the system reduces teachers’ additional concerns on monitoring distracted students, and so forth enhances the comfort
                                in teaching.</p>

                            </figure>
                            <p style="color: #bcbcbc;font-family: Bitter, serif;">When it comes to campus security, there are likely to benefit. Following Forbes(2018), the schools in United States were testing facial recognition systems in order to prevent possible violence attacks, while in Beijing, the
                                Capital of People’s Republic of China, equipped by smart glasses with facial recognition functions, police officers were able to identify possible criminals in crowds more quickly. Concerning these instances, facial or
                                fingerprint recognition tools, et cetera, are suggested taking into consideration by school operators.</p>
                            <p style="color: #bcbcbc;font-size: 16px;font-family: Bitter, serif;">Overall, machine learning and pattern recognition could be customised and deployed to various areas of campus management: Health monitoring, class supervision, and making the campus a safer place. However, there are different
                                voices on the issue of in-school machine learning and pattern recognition, which should not be omitted.</p>
                            <figure class="figure"><img class="figure-img" src="assets/img/FR.png" style="background-image: url(&quot;assets/img/FR.png&quot;);">

                            <h1 style="color: #f2f5f8;font-weight: bold;">Counter Points</h1>
                            <p style="color: #bcbcbc;font-family: Bitter, serif;">The implement of machine learning and pattern recognition in schools is, to some extent controversial, as the opponents quests on its evaluation mechanism, and the possible problems brought to the jobs of teachers. Recent events
                                have shown such phenomena. In the United Kingdom for instance, The National Association of Head Teachers criticised the computer-based machine learning method of ranking schools to be implemented by Ofsted (Mentioned in
                                the beginning) and claimed that such evaluation should be executed by human judges. (BBC, 2017) The Independent(2017) also reported an interview with a college master from Wellington, Sir Anthony Sheldon, who remained skeptical
                                on the implementation of intelligent machines in educational establishments, after praising the revolutionary features of machine learning, stated that, “The great danger is that it takes jobs away, and for humans beings
                                much of our fulfilment in life comes from the satisfaction of work.” Indicating that such pioneering technologies may cause an impact on the job security of teachers. In general, due to the immaturity, and their threats
                                on the traditional education sector, the application of machine learning and pattern recognition may bring inevitable challenges for the schools adopting them.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h1 style="color: #f8f8f8;font-weight: bold;">Conclusion</h1>
                    <p style="color: #bcbcbc;font-size: 16px;font-family: Bitter, serif;">To conclude, machine learning and pattern recognition in schools could help students obtain a more dynamic, customised, and proactive learning atmosphere, assisting teachers with the monitor of students and releasing their workload.
                        Meanwhile, the protection and supervision of the campus may also enjoy the benefit. Although roadblocks including the accuracy of the technologies and the job security issues have emerged, it is believed that, in no small extent,
                        shall the educational sector remained prudential to these technologies, the embrace of machine learning and pattern recognition is of great necessity.</p>
